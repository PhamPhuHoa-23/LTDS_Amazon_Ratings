=== KEY RECOMMENDATION TECHNIQUES FROM KAGGLE SAMPLES ===

## 1. POPULARITY-BASED RECOMMENDATION (Cold Start)
- Target: New users without purchase history
- Method: Rank products by total number of ratings/purchases
- Implementation: groupby('ProductId')['Rating'].count() → sort descending
- Use case: Homepage recommendations, first-time visitors

## 2. COLLABORATIVE FILTERING - USER-ITEM MATRIX
- Create utility matrix: users × products with ratings
- Fill missing values (NaN) with 0 or mean
- Two approaches:
  a) User-based: Find similar users → recommend what they liked
  b) Item-based: Find similar items → recommend similar products

## 3. MATRIX FACTORIZATION (SVD/TruncatedSVD)
- Dimensionality reduction technique
- Decompose sparse matrix into latent factors
- sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD commonly used
- Captures hidden patterns in user preferences

## 4. DATA PREPROCESSING PATTERNS
- Check null values: data.isnull().sum()
- Remove nulls: data.dropna()
- Count unique users/products: nunique()
- Rating distribution analysis: countplot, value_counts
- Filter by minimum ratings threshold (reduce sparsity)

## 5. KEY INSIGHTS TO EXTRACT
- Rating distribution (most common: 5 stars)
- Top N most rated products
- User engagement patterns (ratings per user)
- Sparsity of matrix (most cells empty)
- Power users vs casual users

## 6. EVALUATION METRICS (For Implementation)
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Precision@K, Recall@K
- Hit Rate
- Coverage

## 7. NUMPY IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (No Pandas)
- Use np.genfromtxt or manual parsing for CSV
- Create sparse matrix representation
- Implement cosine similarity: dot(A,B) / (norm(A)*norm(B))
- Vectorized operations for efficiency
- Broadcasting for matrix operations
- Label encoding: Map string IDs to integer indices
- Use np.corrcoef for correlation matrix after SVD

## 8. ADVANCED WEIGHTING TECHNIQUES
a) Time-based weighted rating:
   - Split timestamps into intervals (e.g., <2009, 2009-2011, 2012-2014, 2015-2017)
   - Assign weights: recent=0.33, medium=0.27, older=0.23, oldest=0.17
   - Only include products with ratings in ALL intervals (fairness)
   
b) User-based weighted rating:
   - Segment users by rating count: >50, 21-50, 11-20, 1-10
   - Power users (>50 ratings) get higher weight (0.33)
   - Casual users (1-10 ratings) get lower weight (0.17)
   - Ensures quality feedback is prioritized
   
c) Multi-factor weighted scoring:
   - Combine: Review count (33%) + Purchase count (27%) + Avg rating (40%)
   - Use MinMaxScaler to normalize all features to 1-5 scale
   - Prevents bias from different scales

## 9. BAYESIAN AVERAGE RATING (BAR)
- More sophisticated than simple average
- Accounts for number of ratings (small sample problem)
- Formula: BAR = (C*m + Σr_i) / (C + n)
  where C = confidence (e.g., avg ratings across all products)
        m = mean rating across all products
        n = number of ratings for this product
        Σr_i = sum of ratings for this product

## 10. CORRELATION THRESHOLD
- Common threshold: correlation > 0.90 for recommendations
- Removes the purchased item from recommendations
- Top 10 recommendations typically displayed
