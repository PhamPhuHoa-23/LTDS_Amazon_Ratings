=== AMAZON BEAUTY RATINGS DATASET CHARACTERISTICS ===

## DATASET OVERVIEW
- File: ratings_Beauty.csv
- Total records: 2,023,070 ratings
- Columns: UserId, ProductId, Rating, Timestamp

## DATA TYPES
- UserId: String/Object (unique identifier)
- ProductId: String/Object (unique identifier)  
- Rating: Float (1.0 to 5.0)
- Timestamp: Integer (Unix timestamp)

## KEY STATISTICS
- Unique users: ~1,210,271
- Unique products: ~249,274
- Rating scale: 1.0 to 5.0
- Null values: Some present (need handling)

## RATING DISTRIBUTION PATTERN
- 5 stars: Most common (highly skewed)
- 4 stars: Second most common
- 1-3 stars: Less frequent
- Implication: Positive bias in ratings

## SPARSITY ISSUE
- Huge matrix: 1.2M users × 249K products
- Most cells empty (user hasn't rated product)
- Sparsity: >99.9%
- Strategy: Filter by minimum ratings threshold

## TIMESTAMP INFO
- Unix epoch format (seconds since 1970)
- Useful for temporal analysis:
  * Trending products over time
  * Seasonal patterns
  * User behavior evolution
  * Recency weighting in recommendations

## PROCESSING CHALLENGES
1. Memory: Full matrix too large for RAM
2. Sparsity: Most user-product pairs unknown
3. Cold start: New users/products with no ratings
4. Computational: Distance/similarity calculations expensive

## NUMPY STRATEGIES
- Sample subset for development
- Implement sparse matrix representation
- Filter users/products with min threshold (e.g., ≥5 ratings)
- Vectorized operations (avoid loops)
- Chunked processing for large operations
